cummings (in python) pseudo code

for each token in the input stream:

    if the token is a syntax element "(,)"

         perform the expected behavior:
            '(' open a new frame,
            ',' expect the next argument
            ')' execute the command in the current frame,
                leaving the result in the parent's arg slot


    else if the token is currently undefined:

        if the state does NOT expects a new token

            raise a parser error, UNDEFINED token

        else ( it was so,)
            
            save the token a new definition 
                 list( variable, constant, function, ...)

    else ( the token was defined, so):

        save use the current frame's argument slot, 

	stack a new frame, saving the parent's arg slot as (parent, slot#)
