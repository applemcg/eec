    constant ( PI, 3.1415926 )
    print    ( PI)
    constant ( TwoPI, multiply (2, PI))

    comment  ( the next objective: include an expression evaluator
                 e.g. eec( 2 * PI * r) )
               ALSO, allow multi-line comments and embedded ()â€™s
             )
    print    ( calculate the circumference for a circle of radius 12)
    set      ( r, 12 )

    set      ( TwoPI, multiply (2, PI))

    comment  ( a HUGE idea in Cummings is the absence of quotes )

    set      ( Circumference of the circle, multiply ( TwoPI, r))
    print    ( Circumference of the circle )
    unset    ( Circumference of the circle )

    constant ( space, \  )
    function ( pad, s, concatenate ( space, string(s), space))

    function ( circumference, r,
        multiply( TwoPI, r)
    }
    function ( circ example, r,

       print ( circumference of circle of radius, pad( r)
               circumference( r))
    )

    circ example(  2)  
    circ example( 13)  
    circ example(  8.8)  
 
    comment (
        a. if print is in force, 
           then value is returned as a string. and
        b. numbers go in as a value, and are returned as strings,
	c. at lower levels, i.e. 'print' not in force then
           in and out as values.
