This is the cummings source repostitory.  

Cummings is a computer language in development.

It's two chief new characteristics are:

 * any string, blanks included may be a token, and
 * its purely functional, so that add( $(this), $(that))
   does what you'd expect

At this moment, I'm commiting to github to take advantage of 
_the_cloud_ for three reasons:

 * security, 
 * motivation, and
 * hope/plan for partners

Motivation now includes

 * bringing in the working kernel, describe in the link.
 * time
